- To filter the UFO sighting data, one must type out the desired criteria into the search fields on the left of the screen. Currently on the page, there is an example placeholder criteria entered to provide the user a visual on how to to correctly format criteria information into the fields. 
  - For example, the "Enter a State" field shows that the format required is 2 lowercase alphabetical digits.

 - The Filtered Search Entery Field allows for multiple search criteria. See above, the search criteria was "fresno", and "light."

## Summary:
Drawback:
- The site does not provide a list of citations as to where this information was retreived from for the user to reference. 

Recommendations:
- Provide a heat map of the all the locations on the list after the filtered search is used to show the frequency of the UFO sightenings in that area. 
- User friendly search filter ERROR notice sign with instructions, to provide a solution to an incorrect input.
